Inside the skull, at the base of this horn, is a muscle which is twisted around it— allowing the horn to spin for a time. On the underside of the head runs a wide, grinning mouth, with the skin pulled thin towards its opening. Serrated teeth line the creature's jaws. On each side of its head is a large, bat-like ear, split at the tip. At the end of the bneuptt's body is a short, wide, flat tail, balancing it as it rams into prey."
